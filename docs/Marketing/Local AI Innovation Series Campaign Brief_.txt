Campaign Overview

This campaign, the "Local AI Innovation Series," is designed to increase Digital Allies' brand awareness and establish us as a thought leader in accessible technology within Kingman, Bullhead City, and Lake Havasu. The campaign's core is a seven-part blog series that demystifies Local AI and showcases its practical benefits for our community. Through a multi-channel approach including blog content, social media engagement, and community outreach, we aim to empower local businesses, schools, and residents with the knowledge to leverage technology for growth and efficiency. This initiative directly supports our broader company goal of empowering communities through high-quality, accessible digital solutions.

Objectives

Increase Brand Awareness: Grow website traffic from the tri-city area by 30% over the 10-week campaign period.

Drive Engagement: Achieve an average engagement rate of 5% across all social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn) for campaign-related posts.

Generate Leads: Capture at least 50 new contacts through the "get more information" CTA on the campaign landing page by the end of the 10-week period.

Target Audience

Our campaign targets several key groups within the Mohave County tri-city area:

Local Businesses: Small to medium-sized businesses in Kingman, Bullhead City, and Lake Havasu looking for a competitive edge. Their primary need is to understand how modern technology can increase efficiency, attract customers, and drive growth without a massive budget or steep learning curve.

Community Members (Tech-Curious Residents): Individuals aged 29-40 who are interested in technology and its potential to improve their community. They are looking for accessible information and opportunities to learn new digital skills.

Schools and Government Entities: Local educational institutions and government bodies that are required to meet digital accessibility (ADA) standards. Their main pain point is finding practical, secure, and cost-effective solutions to ensure their digital resources are compliant and serve all community members.

Key Messages

AI is Accessible for Everyone: You don't need to be in Silicon Valley to benefit from AI. We're breaking down complex technology into simple, practical solutions that can help our local community thrive.

Privacy and Security First: With Local AI, your data stays with you. This is especially crucial for schools, libraries, and businesses handling sensitive information, providing a secure alternative to cloud-based systems.
