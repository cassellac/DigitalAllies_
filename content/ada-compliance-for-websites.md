# **ADA Compliance for Websites: A Small Business Guide**

Website accessibility isn’t just about doing the right thing — it protects your business and helps you reach more customers. With legal pressure rising and accessibility standards becoming clearer, making your site inclusive is no longer optional.

* * *

## **Understanding the Legal Landscape**

*   **Courts are clear**: Websites are increasingly considered “places of public accommodation.”
    
*   **Lawsuits are rising**: Over **2,700 ADA Title III lawsuits** in 2023 involved websites ([ADA Title III Blog](https://www.adatitleiii.com/2024/06/federal-court-website-accessibility-lawsuit-filings-took-a-dip-in-2023/)).
    
*   **Broader reporting**: More than **4,500 web/app accessibility lawsuits** (federal + state) were filed in 2023 ([UsableNet](https://info.usablenet.com/ada-website-compliance-lawsuit-tracker)).
    
*   **Overlays don’t protect you**: In 2023, over **900 businesses using widgets** were sued — a 62% jump from 2022 ([3Play Media](https://www.3playmedia.com/blog/key-takeaways-usablenets-ada-web-app-report/)).
    
*   **WCAG is the standard**: The DOJ now requires public entities under ADA to comply with **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** ([NFIB](https://www.nfib.com/news/legal-blog/ada-website-accessibility-how-to-avoid-lawsuits/)).
    

* * *

## **Who Needs to Comply?**

If your business serves the public — online or offline — your site likely must be ADA compliant:

*   Retail stores & restaurants
    
*   E-commerce businesses
    
*   Medical, legal, and professional services
    
*   Hotels, travel, and event businesses
    
*   Educational services and institutions
    
*   Nonprofits, community groups, and government
    

* * *

## **Why Accessibility Makes Business Sense**

*   **1 in 4 adults** in the U.S. has a disability ([Inclind](https://www.inclind.com/news/website-accessibility-statistics-trends)).
    
*   **71% of people with disabilities** leave a site that isn’t accessible ([Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/web-accessibility)).
    
*   Accessibility overlaps with **SEO best practices** — clean HTML, alt text, semantic structure improve rankings ([AccessiBe](https://accessibe.com/blog/knowledgebase/web-accessibility-and-seo)).
    
*   Inclusive brands gain trust, loyalty, and a stronger reputation.

## **Common Accessibility Issues & Solutions**

| **Issue** | **Who It Affects** | **Fix / Best Practice** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Images without alt text | Screen reader users | Add meaningful `alt` text; use `alt=""` for decorative images |
| Low color contrast | Low-vision users, mobile users outdoors | Meet WCAG contrast ratios (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text) |
| Keyboard navigation issues | Users who don’t use a mouse | Ensure all menus, modals, and forms are keyboard-accessible |
| Missing form labels | Screen reader users | Use `<label>` or ARIA attributes linked to input fields |
| Video without captions | Deaf or hard-of-hearing users | Provide captions and transcripts |

👉 A WebAIM study found **95.9% of top websites** had detectable accessibility errors, averaging **56.8 errors per homepage** ([Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/blog/accessibility-statistics)).

## **How to Get Started**

1.  **Audit your site**
    
    *   Tools: [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/), [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/), Lighthouse
        
    *   Manual checks: keyboard-only navigation, screen reader tests
        
2.  **Fix the basics**
    
    *   Add alt text
        
    *   Improve contrast
        
    *   Structure headings properly (`h1` → `h2` → `h3`)
        
    *   Add labels to forms and buttons
        
3.  **Address media accessibility**
    
    *   Caption videos
        
    *   Provide transcripts
        
    *   Offer audio descriptions for key visuals
        
4.  **Test with real users**
    
    *   Partner with disability advocates and testers
        
    *   Gather feedback to improve UX
        
5.  **Document and maintain compliance**
    
    *   Create accessibility statements and policies
        
    *   Train your team on inclusive content creation
